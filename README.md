# Node review language
The language give you the functionality to:

- Configure your review process using states and transitions
- Start the process of reviewing nodes.
- Report on the status of the reviewproces.  

The project contains examples of all things above.

# Background of this project
The project is inspired by the mbeddr codereview language. Problem was that it did not supported our usecase. We do not review code, but business rules instead. Although almost the same, it is a bit different. The codereview language has hard coded states in it and which cannot be configured. Next history of the transitions is added.

# Development / use
This project is developed using Jetbrains MPS version 2019.1.5 using mbeddr platform plugins version  platform-distribution-1.2.21286.4e0beda-MPS-2018.3.4

Any feedback is appreciated.
